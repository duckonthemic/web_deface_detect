# Web Deface Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting web defacement using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to classify whether a website's page is clean or has been defaced by attackers. By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the model is trained to differentiate between legitimate and tampered web pages.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-deface-detection.git
```
### 2. Install dependencies
Install the required Python packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Prepare Dataset
Place the dataset in the dataset directory. The dataset should contain two subdirectories:
clean/: Images of legitimate web pages.
defaced/: Images of tampered or defaced web pages.

### 4. Train the model
Once the dataset is prepared, you can start training the model with the following command:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This will train the model and save it as web_defacement_model.h5 in the models/ directory.

### 5. Test the model
To test the trained model and make predictions on new images, run:

```bash
python predict.py
```
You will need to place the test images in the test_images directory.

### Libraries and Dependencies
This project uses the following libraries:
TensorFlow: For building and training the neural network model.
Keras: High-level API for building and training deep learning models.
OpenCV: For image loading and preprocessing.
NumPy: For array operations and numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing training performance and results.
Pandas: For handling structured data.
scikit-learn: For model evaluation and metrics.

### Training the Model
To train the model, use the following command:
````
python train_model.py
````
This will train the model and save the trained model to the models/ directory.

### Prediction
To make predictions using the trained model, use the following command:
```
python predict.py
```
This will predict whether the images in the test_images/ directory are clean or defaced.

### Report Generation
After the training and prediction, reports will be generated in the reports/ directory. You will get:
Training Report: Contains accuracy and loss metrics during training.
Prediction Report: Contains the prediction results on test images.

### Model Evaluation
You can evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
These metrics will give you an insight into the model's classification performance on clean and defaced web pages.
